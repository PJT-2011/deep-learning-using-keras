# Handwritten Digit Classifier (MNIST)

## Overview
This project is a classic "Hello World" example of Deep Learning. It builds a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** using **TensorFlow** and **Keras** to recognize handwritten numbers from the famous MNIST dataset.

The model is trained on 60,000 images and tested on 10,000 new images, achieving an accuracy of approximately **98%**.

## Tech Stack
* **Environment:** Google Colab
* **Language:** Python 3.x
* **Libraries:**
    * `TensorFlow` / `Keras` (Model building)
    * `NumPy` (Data manipulation)
    * `Matplotlib` (Visualization)

## Results
* **Training Accuracy:** ~99%
* **Test Accuracy:** ~98%
* **Loss Function:** Sparse Categorical Crossentropy
* **Optimizer:** Adam

## How to Run
1.  Open the file `mnist_classifier.ipynb` in this repository.
2.  Click the "Open in Colab" badge (if visible) or download the file and upload it to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
